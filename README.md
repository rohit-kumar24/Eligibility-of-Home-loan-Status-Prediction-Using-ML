# Eligibility-of-Home-loan-Status-Prediction-Using-ML
Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict the eligibility status of home loan 
applicants based on various financial and demographic factors. Leveraged a diverse dataset of 
historical loan applications to train predictive models, including logistic regression and ensemble methods.
Conducted feature engineering and implemented rigorous model evaluation techniques to ensure accuracy.

Skills Utilized: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Python, 
Logistic Regression, Ensemble Methods, Financial Data Analysis.

Impact: Streamlined the home loan approval process by automating eligibility predictions, reducing manual workload,
and improving decision-making efficiency. The project contributes to faster and more accurate loan processing, 
enhancing the overall experience for both applicants and financial institutions.
